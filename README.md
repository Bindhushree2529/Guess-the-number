# Guess-the-number
In the "Guess the Number" game, the program generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user tries to guess the number, and the program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number. This project involves random number generation, loops, and conditionals.
